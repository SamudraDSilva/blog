# Problem Statement

Date: 03-02-2026
Author: Samudra de Silva
Project: Samudra's blog

## The problem

## What problem am I solving?

I want complete control over my blog without depending on platform like Medium, Wordpress.

## Who is this for?

- Primary User: Me (as both developer and blog author)
- Secondary Users: Readers who find my blog (general public)

## why build from scratch?

1. Build something I can fully debug and customize
2. Understand cashing, performance, and scaling concepts
3. Learn deployment
4. Learn how authentication actually works

## What does success look like?

Phase 1 Success(Month 1):

- I can create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Posts are stored in PostgresSQL database
- I have basic authentication(only I can post)
- Blog is live on a domain
- I understand evey line of code

## Why This Matters

I'm stuck in tutorial hell and have no real portfolio projects. Building this from scratch will force me to solve real problems, document real decisions, and have something concrete.Even if the blog itself isn't used by anyone, the learning process will make me a real developer.

## Constraints

### Time

- Target: 2-4 hours per day, 2-4 days per week
- Deadline: Have Phase 1 deployed in 4 weeks

### Budget

- Domain ~ $12/yr
- VPS hosting
- Will use: Free tiers wherever possible

### Technical

- Know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, some React
- Learning: Next.js, PostgreSQL, authentication, deployment
- Don't know: DevOps, cloud services, scaling, security best practices
- Willing to learn: Everything needed

## Success Metrics

### Learning Metrics:

- [] Can explain my entire architecture without notes
- [] Can deploy updates without breaking production
- [] Can debug issues using logs and tools
- [] Have 20+ documented decisions/learnings

### Product Metrics:

- [] Blog loads in <2 seconds
- [] Zero security vulnerabilities (basic scan)
- [] Can handle 100 concurrent users
